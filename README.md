  <h1>Hello folks, I'm Ningxiao 👨‍💻🏀🏂🎮</h1>  
 </div>
 <div align="left">
I am a multi-disciplinary designer and now a full stack software engineer, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences to the table. With over six years in delivering cheerful and intuitive user experiences across mobile apps, SaaS products, and even landscape architecture and urban planning, I have honed my abilities to create engaging digital products.
<br/>
<br/>
I found my passion in software engineering when I started learning basic coding because I always want to bridge the communication gap between designers and engineers. I always enjoyed problem solving and eager to learn new technical skills. The more I learned coding, the more I love coding. Now I am looking for a full-time position as a software engineer.
